# Overall comments
The code indentation is inconsistent all throughout the codebase, which makes it hard to read. You also
have a lot of simple mistakes like using "==" instead of "===".

A lot of this can be easily fixed/caught using tooling like prettier to format your code, and es-lint to find common
javascript mistakes. This two tools is pretty much required on every node app you write.

https://eslint.org/

There are tons of magic going on this code, I would create classes for all the object models being used (pokemon, 
pokeball, etc). I would also add getters and setters to make sure that every field is documented and declared before
being used. Another benefit of this is that you make it easier for the IDE to help you navigate the code. If you 
use a lot of magic in your code, it's impossible for your IDE to help you catch mistakes, or simply use 
jump to code features.

Another thing I noticed is the amount of dead code and files left behind. I understand you wanted to leave a trail of
the process of building the bot, but in reality all it does is add a lot of confusion as its not immediately clear whats
being used, and it is not. I would remove the whole `deprecated` folder, and the `pokemonSmogon.json` if its not used.

## Configuration Settings
The bot has a selection of configuration settings that can be changed by the server owner or a registered server admin. The full list of settings along with examples on how to use them are listed below:

  `%setconf prefix (Non-alphanumeric Character)`
  
  Sets the bot's prefix for your server to a given character: `%setconf prefix !`
  
  ___

  `setconf denpkmnonly (true | false)`
  
  Toggles between fetching Pok√©mon statistics from only those that can appear in Sword and Shield Max Raid Dens: `%setconf denpkmnonly true`
  
  ___

  `%setconf shinypkmnonly (true | false)`
  
  Toggles between displaying shiny Pok√©mon sprites only: `%setconf shinypkmnonly true`
  ___
  
  `%setconf restrictedchannels (channel-one, channel-two, etc)`
  
  Restricts Alcremie-B to only respond in the channels listed. Alcremie-B will respond to server admins and server owner regardless of this setting: `%setconf restrictedchannels alcremie-test, botspam`
  
  ___

The following is what `%showconf` would look like after performing each of the above example commands:

```json

{
 "prefix": "!",
 "denpkmnonly": true,
 "shinypkmnonly": true,
 "restrictedchannels": [
  {
   "name": "alcremie-test",
   "id": "ID#"
  },
  {
   "name": "botspam",
   "id": "ID#"
  }
 ]
}

```
